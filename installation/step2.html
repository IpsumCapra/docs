		The second step runs a few key tests on your server to confirm that Form Tools will be able to run. The full
        system requirements are <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/getting_started/system_requirements/">outlined here</a>,
		but the most common problems encountered on this page are these:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
            <b>MySQL version identified as incorrect</b>. Form Tools requires MySQL 4 or later to run.
		</li>
		<li>
            <b>Write permissions</b>. The /themes/default/cache and /upload folders needs to be read-writable.
			If you're on a Windows server, you may need to contact your hosting provider to ask them
			to set the folder permissions.
        </li>
	</ul>
