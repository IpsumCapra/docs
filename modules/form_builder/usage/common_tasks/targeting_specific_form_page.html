  <h3>Adding something to a specific form page</h3>

  <p>
    Forms published through the Form Builder each use a specific template for each
    of its pages: the main <i>Form Page</i> template, the <i>Review Page</i> or
    <i>Thankyou</i> template. If you're using a View that groups your form fields into
    multiple tabs, those tabs are converted to separate form pages in the published form -
    and each of those pages will use the same <i>Form Page</i> template.
  </p>

  <p>
    Customizing the Review and Thankyou pages are easy: there's only ever one of them
    in your form: so you can just edit that particular template type to add in whatever
    you want. But what about your form pages? How do you customize a specific form page?
  </p>

  <p>
    It's actually very simple.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select the Form Builder module from your Modules page.</li>
    <li>Select the Template Set you're using in your published form.</li>
    <li>Edit the <i>Form Page</i> template you're using in your published form.</li>
    <li>In that page, add the following code:

      {% raw %}
  <textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty2">
{{if $current_page == 2}}
  Hello World!
{{/if}}</textarea>
      {% endraw %}

    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    That will output "hello world!" <i>only</i> on the second form page - not on your
    other form pages. You can use the same technique to add anything you want to any
    of your specific form pages.
  </p>

  <h4>Specifying a form or View</h4>

  <p>
    If you're re-using the Template Set for multiple published forms, you may find you
    only want to add something to a particular form or View. To do that, we just expand
    on our previous code. The following example will only output "Hello World" on
    the second form page for forms with ID = 12.
  </p>

{% raw %}
<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty2">
{{if $current_page == 2 && $form_id == 12}}
  Hello World!
{{/if}}</textarea>
{% endraw %}

  <p>
    Similarly, you can target a particular View, like so:
  </p>

{% raw %}
<textarea class="codemirror" data-lang="smarty2">
{{if $current_page == 2 && $view_id == 38}}
  Hello World!
{{/if}}</textarea>
{% endraw %}

  <p>
    The form IDs are found on the main Forms page (first column). The View IDs are listed
    on the Edit Form -&gt; Views tab.
  </p>
